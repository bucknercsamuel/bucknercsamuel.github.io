During this internship, I worked with the New Glenn fluids control team to characterize and analyze a closed-loop fluids control system. This included the following tasks:
<ol>
    <li> Developed a collection of unit test suites (MATLAB/Simulink) for New Glenn autonomous fluid control applications with extensive code coverage </li>
    <li> Assessed controller performance in response to off-nominal scenarios and systematic uncertainties </li>
    <li> Improved plant dynamics modeling validated against external CFD results </li>
    <li> Implemented several software workflow improvements intended for general usage </li>
</ol>
