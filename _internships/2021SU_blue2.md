During this internship, I worked with the New Glenn navigation team to apply the **V**ectorized **A**uto**r**egressive **I**ntegrated **M**oving **A**verage (**V-ARIMA**) algorithm to state estimation. This included the following tasks:
<ol>
    <li> Developed Simulink and C++ flight code implementations of Vector-ARIMA timeseries forecasting for prediction & estimation of an autonomous vehicle navigational state </li>
    <li> Built up Monte Carlo framework for dispersed vehicle trajectories with CONOPS-accurate kinematic modeling </li>
    <li> Implemented new uplink data compression methods and assessed model noise sensitivity </li>
    <li> Conducted three-sigma performance assessments to verify operational reliability </li>
</ol>
