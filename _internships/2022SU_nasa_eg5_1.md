During this tour, I consulted with a private industry partner (Astrobotic) to develop multiple new convex-optimization-based guidance algorithms to model state triggered constraints (STCs) for real-time, autonomous precision landing in a lunar environment. This involved development of two different iterative approaches:
<ol>
    <li> Direct integration of the STC solution process with a time-of-flight univariate optimization ontop of a lossless convexification problem </li>
    <li> STC modeling using the S-procedure with sequential convex programming </li>
</ol>
