This tour consisted of three different high-level tasks:
<ol>
    <li> Research on the Constrained Visibility Guidance (CVG) problem formulation and solution methods </li>
    <li> Application of CVG to the Astrobotic mission context (continuation of research from previous tour) </li>
    <li> Side project supporting the HLS program (Lunar Starship) </li>
</ol>

This tour resulted in several conference publications at SciTech 2024 {% cite buckner2024constrained %}{% cite shaffer2024implementation %}, with one formulation being selected for flight implementation on a future lunar landing mission.
