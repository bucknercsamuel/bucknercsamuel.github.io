I am a fourth-year Ph.D. student in the [Aeronautics & Astronautics Department at the University of Washington](https://www.aa.washington.edu/), working with the [Autonomous Controls Laboratory](https://uwacl.com/) under Dr. Behçet Açıkmeşe. My research interests are divided between developing practical, real-time numerical algorithms and applying them to relevant real-world scenarios in aerospace engineering and, more broadly, in autonomous systems. This constitutes:

* **Convex Optimization** *(Convex Approximation Methods)*
* **Real-Time Trajectory Optimization** *(Sequential Convex Programming)*
* **Perception-In-The-Loop Planning** *(Active Navigation)*
* **Main Applications:**
    * **Rocketry:** Powered Descent Guidance, Rendezvous Maneuvers
    * **Aerial Vehicles:** Multirotors, eVTOLs

Academically, I graduated *Summa Cum Laude* from the University of Florida with a B.S. in Aerospace Engineering (2020), and am the recipient of both the NSF GRFP and ARCS fellowships for graduate research. Professionally, I have spent six rotations working with [NASA](https://www.nasa.gov/) as a [Pathways Co-Op](https://www.nasa.gov/careers/pathways/), as well as two internships in the spaceflight industry with [Blue Origin](https://www.blueorigin.com/).
