**C**onstrained **V**isibility **G**uidance (**CVG**) presents a novel approach to modeling terrain scanning constraints for powered landing maneuvers using a novel *theory of constrained conic intersections*. This includes two separate levels of algorithmic fidelity:
<ol>
    <li> A high-fidelity 6-DoF (translation + rotation) model using sequential convex programming (SCP) </li>
    <li> A medium-fidelity 3-DoF (translation-only) model using lossless convexification (LCvx) </li>
</ol>

Both of these models were developed as part of my 2023 rotation at the NASA Johnson Space Center.
