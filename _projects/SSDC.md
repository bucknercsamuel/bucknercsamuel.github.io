During the 2019 year, I acted as the internal Vice-President for the SSDC (Space Systems Design Club), managing competition and project participation including CanSat, Micro-G Next and the gyroscopic chair outreach project. Furthermore, I acted as the lead structures and dynamics engineer for the 2017-2018 CanSat competition team, which required development of a small “re-entry vehicle” which must stabilize under chaotic rocket deployment, eject parachutes and collect telemetry readings of the surroundings while protecting a delicate payload.
